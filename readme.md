# AI and COVID-19 Project Prototype

## Overview

This Python project is a COVID-19 Dashboard and Assessment Test, created using Plotly and Dash. It allows users to view COVID-19 statistics and trends, as well as assess their probability of having COVID-19 based on their symptoms and their severity. The project also provides guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO) based on the received assessment percentage.

### Features:

- **COVID-19 Dashboard:** Stay informed about the current COVID-19 situation with interactive visualizations and up-to-date statistics.

- **Assessment Test:** Assess your probability of having COVID-19 based on the symptoms you provide and the severity of those symptoms. Receive a percentage value indicating the likelihood of having the virus. Get relevant guidelines from the WHO based on your assessment.

- **Built with Dash and Plotly:** The web application is developed using Dash, a Python framework for building web applications, and Plotly, a powerful library for creating interactive data visualizations.

## Usage

### COVID-19 Dashboard

The COVID-19 Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the COVID-19 pandemic, with interactive visualizations and real-time statistics. Users can explore various aspects of the pandemic, including:

- **Global and Local Statistics:** Get up-to-date data on the number of cases, recoveries, and deaths, both globally and for specific regions.

- **Trends and Graphs:** Explore trends in cases over time, analyze data with interactive graphs, and gain insights into the progression of the pandemic.

- **Heatmaps:** Visualize the distribution of cases on geographical heatmaps, helping users understand the regional impact of COVID-19.

### Assessment Test

The Assessment Test feature allows users to assess their probability of having COVID-19. Here's how it works:

1. **Symptom Selection:** Users select the symptoms they are experiencing from a list provided in the application.

2. **Symptom Severity:** After selecting symptoms, users are prompted to indicate the severity of each symptom, e.g., mild, moderate, severe.

3. **Assessment Result:** The application calculates a percentage value, indicating the likelihood of having COVID-19 based on the symptoms and their severity.

4. **WHO Guidelines:** The project displays relevant guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO) based on the received assessment percentage, offering guidance on next steps and precautions.

By using this Assessment Test, users can gain insights into their health status and receive guidance on whether they should seek medical attention or take preventive measures.

### Technologies Used

This web application is built using Dash and Plotly:

- **Dash:** Dash is a Python web framework that enables the creation of interactive, web-based data applications with pure Python.

- **Plotly:** Plotly is a versatile and powerful library for creating interactive and customizable data visualizations, including charts and graphs.

This combination of technologies allows for a user-friendly and interactive experience while ensuring that the data presented is both informative and engaging.

We hope this project helps you stay informed about COVID-19 and assess your health during these challenging times.
