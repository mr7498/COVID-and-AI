## Usage

The COVID-19 Dashboard provides visualizations and statistics related to the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing users to stay informed about the current situation.

The Assessment Test feature allows users to assess their probability of having COVID-19 based on the symptoms they provide and the severity of those symptoms. The test provides a percentage value, indicating the likelihood of having the virus. Additionally, the project displays relevant guidelines from the WHO based on the received assessment percentage.
